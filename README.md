# Hi, I'm Lukas

I am a fullstack developer. I usually work alone and focus on building tools and software that try to reduce redundant tasks. I tend to work on projects that interest me or solve a specific problem I encounter.

## About Me
- I primarily use Python, MQL5 and Rust.  
- I also have experience with C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Kotlin for Android development.   
- My previous work includes websites, networked Python applications using Flask and Waitress, mods for games such as adding multiplayer to Shapez 2, and trading bots written in MQL5 for MetaTrader 5.  
- I write code to improve my workflow.

## Skills & Tools
Python | MQL5 | Rust (learning) | C# | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Kotlin | Flask | Waitress | Windows | VS Code

## Current Project
